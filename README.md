# Build Bug Variable Frequency Drive Configuration Repository

This repo contains the configuration values for a WEG CFW-300 variable frequency drive (VFD).
The WEG Programming Swuite (WPS) software creates these files and they are edited exclusively
using the WPS user interface. The config values herein are intended for use as an external backup
and to track changes.
